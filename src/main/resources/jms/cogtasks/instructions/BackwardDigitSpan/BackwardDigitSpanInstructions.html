			<h2>Instructions</h2>
			<h3>Presentation Phase</h3>
			<br>
			This is the backward digit span task, a task that involves the presentation of a series of numbers (between 1-99) that you
			must remember. A trial will consist of <span class='highlight_red'>between 2 and 7</span> numbers for you to remember. They will be shown one at a time in the center of the screen.

			<h3>Recall Phase</h3>
			<br>
			After all the numbers in a given trial have been presented to you it is your turn: type in the numbers you remember seeing backwards. It is important to remember to type them <span class='highlight_red'>backwards</span>, that is, if you saw 21 33 54, then you should type 54 33 21. The program will ask for one number at a time (the message "Number 1: " etc) and you must type it in and press enter to submit it.
