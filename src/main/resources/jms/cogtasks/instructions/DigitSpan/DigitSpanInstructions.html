			<h2>Instructions</h2>
			<h3>Presentation Phase</h3>
			<br>
			This is the digit span task, a task that involves the presentation of a series of numbers (between 1-99) that you
			must remember. A trial will consist of <span class='highlight_red'>between 2 and 7</span> numbers for you to remember. They will be shown one at a time in the center of the screen. 
			<br>

			<h3>Recall Phase</h3>
			<br>
			After all the numbers in a given trial have been presented to you it is your turn to type in the numbers you remember seeing. It is important to remember that the <span class='highlight_red'>order matters</span>, so put the numbers in the order you remember seeing them. The program will ask for one number at a time (the message "Number 1: " etc) and you must type it in and press enter to submit it.
